            <h1>Use of the Technology to businesses</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="indent">In order to fully explore the future of money and its impact on businesses, both the present and future are discussed. Recent developments in technology have shown globally that we are advancing toward a cashless society. In addition, the rise of the internet and social media has meant that businesses around the world are having to expand their online presence in the form of social media advertising and online shopping websites. This is due to the increased availability of access to mobile devices with internet access and many other ways to pay for goods and services online. Recent reports show that an estimated 1,267 shops were closed or earmarked for closure since January 2018 <a href="bibliography.html">(Telegraph, 2018)</a>.</p>
                <p>This was due to the influx in major businesses shifting towards the online shopping department, major stores such as Toys R Us and Maplin entered administration arguably as a result of their slow transfer to the online shopping industry. Between the Two companies they had closed down 322 stores and employees lost 5,500 jobs. However, in comparison, online shopping has been more popular than ever soon to overtake the high street shopping. A few of the major factors surrounding online shopping recent surge in popularity include convenience, shopping from the comfort of their home, online retailers offering free returns, discounts and next day delivery. Expanding on the discounts offered, the recent Black Friday sales in which items were being sold for up to 80% off the original price, show how online retail discounts are highly beneficial to the consumers. The change in how consumers demand their product has caused major businesses to adapt their business strategies to compete with online competitors such as Amazon, eBay, etc.</p>

                    <figcaption>Graph2: Almost one in five purchases are now made online - Online and in store sales as a percentage of total retail sales</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The graph represents the recent profitability of the online shopping market. Over the last ten years, in-store retail sales have lost 17% to the online market and it continues to grow as many other small businesses are beginning to expand their online presence and high street stores continue to struggle increasingly due to factors such as the national living wage increasing the cost of hiring staffs in the UK. As well as Brexit causing a lack of business confidence which has further increased the cost of running a high street store. While online shopping has made it easier for consumers, businesses now have to do more to meet the increased logistical needs on their end.</p>
                <p>The retail industry is not the only industry facing change both from consumers and businesses. The video game industry is also experiencing change and development, which comes in the form of microtransactions. Micro transactions initially found their way into the mainstream through the free-to-play business model in which businesses do not charge for the product initially but aim to make profits through in-game advertisement and sales.</p>
                <p>The free-to-play business model reached the peak of its success when Fortnite released in October 2017. At its peak, Fortnite reached a peak player count of 200 million players. The business behind Fortnite, Epic Games made $126 million over the month of February 2018 <a href="bibliography.html">(Forbes, 2018)</a>. The success of microtransactions leads to them being adopted into the business strategies of the major companies in the industry, resulting in games being sold to consumers at undiscounted prices but with microtransactions being implemented into core parts of the game. By incentivising consumers to purchase an in-game currency with real currency through an in game microtransactions within a product that has already been paid for, Major businesses have been involved in legal battles as a result of their microtransaction practices. Belgium declared the <q>Loot box</q> microtransaction within EA games’ <q>FIFA 18</q> and <q>Star Wars Battlefront</q> as well as several other games to be in violation of their gambling legislation <a href="bibliography.html">(BBC, 2018)</a>. The games companies involved could be subject to a £697,000 fine, as a result of their malpractices involving the use of microtransactions as gambling tools within their games. </p>
                <p>Businesses have changed to incorporate contactless and online payment methods into more of their transactions. The impact of online payment methods on businesses can be see-through recent trends such as PayPal and eWallets for cryptocurrency have made banking transactions incredibly simple and convenient for daily consumers and since the introduction of NFC, making it also possible to make contactless payments through smartphones. As we have seen in recent times, soon our shopping experiences will feature less human contact as a self-service interface could replace cashiers for the most part. This would be due to contactless payment being the dominant method of payment and requiring minimal human interaction due to the absence of cash. This would save businesses money in the long run as they would no longer need to employ as much staff as machines do not need rest or sick days. Also, a small team of engineers can maintain many machines so the overall employee wage costs are reduced.</p>
                <p>The future of cryptocurrency is a de-centralised currency that is used by the whole world in place of any individual currency. Such a move away from the Dollar as the main trading currency would be beneficial to businesses. Due to the fact that any single countries economy cannot cause major fluctuations in the value of the de-centralised currency. This, in turn, minimises the losses that businesses take when trading currencies for international trade. This could allow globalisation to reach a new level, as the trade barriers between multinational corporations cease to exist. Developing countries would be able to trade without the value of their local currency hindering trade with more developed countries. There would also be less administrative clutter for businesses as employees are no longer needed to handle currency exchange for international transactions. The main issue with cryptocurrency, however, is that it has shown in recent history, it can be unpredictably volatile. Bitcoin, one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, has had a very volatile history. The price of bitcoin peaked at $19,783 on December 17, 2018, but not up to a week later fell below $11,000, a 45% fall in value within a week <a href="bibliography.html">(Business Insider, 2017)</a>. If a de-centralised currency becomes widely used globally but suffers a sudden turn of volatility, the negative effects would be felt worldwide and could be catastrophic.</p>
