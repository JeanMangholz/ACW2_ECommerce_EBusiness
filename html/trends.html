                    <p class="indent">Money has a story as long as that of commerce and transactions. It is an essential part for economic activity. Its story is linked to the human history for almost 3,000 years. At the beginning of humanity, humans were bartering goods. The first known currency was created in Lydia (Turkey) by King Alyattes in 600BC. Then over the years, coins evolved into bank notes around 1661 AD <a href="bibliography.html">(Telegraph,2014)</a>.</p>
                    <p>In October, 1929, just after the market crash, the UK faced an economic crisis and its currency, the pound, lost value by 40%. At the same time, it abandoned monetary system gold standard, used since XIX century. The monetary unit referred to a fixed weight in gold.
                    Then, in 1946, the first credit card appeared and in 2008, with the arrival of new technologies like Radio Frequency Identification<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup>and Near Field Communication<sup><a href="#section2">[2]</a></sup>, new safety precautions, like the contactless credit card, showed up on the market. The contactless credit card has revolutionized how people purchase, and has made it easier to consume goods.This fact is highlighted by Nigek Phair in <font>The Truth about Contactless Payments</font>. Phair says <q>In Australia, there has been a 42% growth in contactless card accounts between 2014 and 2015, along with an increase in average frequency of use per unique contactless account. Contactless penetration has grown to the point where 74% of all MasterCard in-store transactions are now contactless. Specifically:
                        <ul class="square">
                            <li><q>89% of tapped transactions are under $50</q></li>
                            <li><q>67% of tapped transactions are below $25</q></li>
                            <li><q>31% of tapped transactions are below $10</q></li>
                        </ul>
                        </q>
                        Indeed, consumers can buy more easily because they don't have to search for coins, or even need to carry any. They just have to use their credit card without entering the pin. This technology is increasing the speed for small transactions. It has also allowed merchants to increase their transaction volumes (20 seconds for paying with contactless payments instead of 38 seconds for a contact payment) and reduce the cost per transaction ($0.11 versus $0.20 for a contact transaction) <a href="bibliography.html">(Nigek Phair in <font>The Truth about Contactless Payments</font>, 2016)</a></p>.
                    <p>Then, with the growth of smartphones connected to Internet, new innovations are introduced on the market: cash application, mobile payment, and crypto-currency. There is a growing interest for mobile wallet. The following statistic <a href="bibliography.html">(Statista website, 2018) </a>reports the number of users of mobile payment platforms as of August 2017: 600 million users are using WeChat Pay as mobile payment, and Alipay was ranked second with 400 million users worldwide. Paypal, the third actor, is the first player having understood the risk of card fraud. The widespread interest for e-wallet is not confined to mobile, but also to every connected device. The bank Barclaycard is proposing to its customers to pay with bracelets, watches, etc. <a href="bibliography.html">(Barclaycard website, ND)</a></p>

                    <p>The evolution of payment is not finished and, since 2011, new currencies, called crypto currencies, are on the market. They are very popular since the quick increase of the Bitcoin in 2013. They now are challenging the paper money. The integration of these new currencies is a huge challenge for banks and for the economy. However when we have a look into the bitcoin prices, we notice that it is really volatile. There is a huge collapse of the prices: $19.499 in 12/17 <a href="bibliography.html">(Le Point, 2018)</a>; $4.958,36 in 11/18. With these kind of fluctuations, how can we consider this currency as credible? For a currency to lose more than 75% of its value, does not happen often…</p>
                    <p>Another electronic currency is rising on the market: gaming currency in video games. As presented in the section Description of technology, this e-money is created and used only for video games. Usually, the more the players play and have good achievements, the more they can earn and acquire e-money. They can also buy e-money using real-world currency to further improve their virtual experience. According to Donghee Yvette Wohn, “the global market of virtual goods was $14.8 billion in 2012”, this number should be higher today as the number of gamers increased to 32.4 m gamers in the UK in 2017 compared to 31.6m gamers in 2016 (Ukie). This virtual currency can be used by the player to customize their avatars, to buy virtual goods, or to level up quicker than others, etc… Furthermore, for some games, players can sell their account to other players for real money or crypto-currencies.</p>
                    <p>Despite these innovations and evolutions, some companies, like Bartercard, promote the exchange of goods and services without the use of cash or equivalent. We are seeing a return to the past and to the origin of commerce. Bartercard is now the first operator of barter trading exchange in the world <a href="bibliography.html">(Telegraph, 2014)</a>.
                    <p>In this report, we have considered that the serious trends are the payment with credit card, contactless payment, e-wallet (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, etc.), and crypto-currencies.
