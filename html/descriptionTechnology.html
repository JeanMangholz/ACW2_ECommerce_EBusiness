                <h2>Money</h2>
                <p class="indent">Money is a medium of exchange, and we use money as a means of measuring the worth and value of goods and services <a href="bibliography.html">(University of Minnesota, ND)</a>. Before the invention of money, people would trade their wares between each other. Now in the 21st century, physical money is becoming closer and closer to being obsolete <a href="bibliography.html">(Regalado, 2012)</a>. Even though money and its technologies have changed a lot since it was first created, money remains an exchange medium, regardless of what form it takes <a href="bibliography.html">(Investopedia, 2018)</a>. </p>

                <p>As time goes by we are moving away from the use of physical money, as money  now exists in a purely electronic form. Not only can we conduct money transfers and payment transactions online but now there exists money with little to no physical connection or real-world presence whatsoever. This is called e-money <a href="bibliography.html">(European Commision, N.D)</a>. One example of a type of e-money is currency in video games. Virtual currencies in video games are used to pay for services provided online or acquire virtual goods, and as currency in video games has a fixed exchange rate to real money, that has been defined by its developers, the ‘value’ of this form of virtual money can be decided upon <a href="bibliography.html">(Vlastov, 2017)</a>. Cryptocurrencies are another form of electronic money. A unique form of money due to the fact that it is used solely for online transactions and has absolutely no connections to material objects and only exists as information <a href="bibliography.html">(Vlastov, 2017)</a>. </p>
                <p>In this report, the future trends of money and the associated technologies will be discussed, alongside their impacts of the economic market and businesses.</p>
