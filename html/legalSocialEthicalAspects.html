                <h1>Legal, Social and Ethical aspects</h1>
                <h2>Legal Aspects</h2>
                
                <p class="indent">Currency has been used in one form or another for the past 5000 years<a href="bibliography.html">(Kusimba, 2017)</a> and with the advancement of technology and the adoption of the internet at 81% by the developed world, there have been an influx of cryptocurrencies. As of December 2018, there are 2,512 cryptocurrencies with a market capacity of $126,393,067,757 <a href="bibliography.html">(Investing.com, 2018)</a>.</p>

                <p>Fiat money is a type of currency without intrinsic value that is created by government regulation. First used in China in the late 10th century <a href="bibliography.html">(Hille, 2017)</a>, most currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro and Pound Sterling are no longer reliant on commodities such as gold.</p>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are not fiat currency or legal tender and consequently cannot be used for certain exchanges. Legal tender is a type of payment that is recognised by a country's legal system as a valid method meeting a financial obligation <a href="bibliography.html">(Royal Mint, 2008)</a>. Both parties of a transaction are naturally free to accept any form of payment. By using legal tender the debtor cannot be sued for non-payment if they pay into court with legal tender. The impact of this on the adoption of cryptocurrencies however is very small. In the United States of America <a href="bibliography.html">(Gpo.gov, 2011)</a> and the United Kingdom <a href="bibliography.html">(Bank of England, 2017)</a>, shops do not have to accept legal tender and can except any form of payment they choose. Credit/debit cards are also not legal tender, yet in 2018 in the United Kingdom debit cards were used 13.2bn times with cash responsible for 13.1bn transactions.</p>
                <p>Another legal aspect of the introduction of cryptocurrencies is the way in which they are classified when it comes to taxes. In the United States, virtual currencies are treated as property. According to the Internal Revenue Service, anything purchased using a virtual currency is liable to be taxed as a capital gain <a href="bibliography.html">(Helmore, 2018)</a>. This means that if a person purchases a 100 of a virtual currency for £25 each, and a day later they sell 50 of their virtual currency for £30 each, their profit would be (£30 * 50 - £25 * 50) = (£5*50) = £250. This £250 is taxable and if the individual has no remaining Personal Allowance, they will have to pay a percentage of this profit to the government in the form of income tax for individuals at rates of 10% or 20% depending on the individuals income. This makes using cryptocurrency a lot more difficult as it requires the individual to calculate the amount of tax they owe based on the current exchange rate of every transaction the make.</p>
