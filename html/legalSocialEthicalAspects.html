                <h2>Legal Aspects</h2>
                
                <p class="indent">Currency has been used in one form or another for the past 5000 years<a href="bibliography.html">(Kusimba, 2017)</a> and with the advancement of technology and the adoption of the internet at 81% by the developed world, there have been an influx of cryptocurrencies. As of December 2018, there are 2,512 cryptocurrencies with a market capacity of $126,393,067,757 <a href="bibliography.html">(Investing.com, 2018)</a>.</p>

                <p>Fiat money is a type of currency without intrinsic value that is created by government regulation. First used in China in the late 10th century <a href="bibliography.html">(Hille, 2017)</a>, most currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro and Pound Sterling are no longer reliant on commodities such as gold.</p>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are not fiat currency or legal tender and consequently cannot be used for certain exchanges. Legal tender is a type of payment that is recognised by a country's legal system as a valid method meeting a financial obligation <a href="bibliography.html">(Royal Mint, 2008)</a>. Both parties of a transaction are naturally free to accept any form of payment. By using legal tender the debtor cannot be sued for non-payment if they pay into court with legal tender. The impact of this on the adoption of cryptocurrencies however is very small. In the United States of America <a href="bibliography.html">(Gpo.gov, 2011)</a> and the United Kingdom <a href="bibliography.html">(Bank of England, 2017)</a>, shops do not have to accept legal tender and can except any form of payment they choose. Credit/debit cards are also not legal tender, yet in 2018 in the United Kingdom debit cards were used 13.2bn times with cash responsible for 13.1bn transactions.</p>
                <p>Another legal aspect of the introduction of cryptocurrencies is the way in which they are classified when it comes to taxes. In the United States, virtual currencies are treated as property. According to the Internal Revenue Service, anything purchased using a virtual currency is liable to be taxed as a capital gain <a href="bibliography.html">(Helmore, 2018)</a>. This means that if a person purchases a 100 of a virtual currency for £25 each, and a day later they sell 50 of their virtual currency for £30 each, their profit would be (£30 * 50 - £25 * 50) = (£5*50) = £250. This £250 is taxable and if the individual has no remaining Personal Allowance, they will have to pay a percentage of this profit to the government in the form of income tax for individuals at rates of 10% or 20% depending on the individuals income. This makes using cryptocurrency a lot more difficult as it requires the individual to calculate the amount of tax they owe based on the current exchange rate of every transaction the make.</p>

                <h2>Social</h2>
                <p class="indent">The future of money has a massive social affect as money is a major social convection and it is a constant factor within our lives. These technologies are becoming more mainstream as we go into the future and have already had an effect on those who have adopted the technologies. One way in which the future of money is changing is through contactless technology, this technology is already having a big effect on society as mobile phones are now being used to process contactless payments now, with an increase of users choosing this option every year. <a href="bibliography.html">(Finextra, 2018)</a> This technology is possibly going to mean an end for physical currency,<a href="bibliography.html">(Sivabalan, 2017)</a> which has the potential to have massive affect on society as physical currency has been a cornerstone of society as early as 5,000 B.C <a href="bibliography.html">(Wonderopolis, N.D)</a>.</p>
                <p>One place where this is already becoming a reality is Sweden with cash payments dropping to 15% of transactions within the retail sector, some shops within Sweden have even made the full transition into no longer handling cash <a href="bibliography.html">(Savage, 2018)</a>. Using contactless technology can have many social benefits to both consumer and businesses, firstly by eliminating physical cash from a transaction it reduces workload on people because contactless is very easy to use as it just requires the user to place their device or card near a wireless receiver. Human error is also removed by using contactless as people may miscount change therefore slowing down transactions which effects both consumer and business. Another social benefit of contactless is how it minimises robbery as there is no cash to rob physically as well as the convenience and speed of contactless transactions is a big appeal and  for both consumer and business it can be seen as very convenient as money as process straight through to banks <a href="bibliography.html">(Finextra, 2004)</a>. Because of the ease of use and the speed of contactless payments it is becoming the payment choice of the future as if something is easier to use people will generally choose it over the alternative <a href="bibliography.html">(Trütsch, 2014)</a>.</p>
                <p>However there is some perceived negatives to the use of contactless payments, as contactless payments require no verification to purchase items thieves can use peoples cards very easily and spend money before a user knows they have lost it, this has already had effect on people who choose to use contactless and in April 2018 stolen cards where being used at a rate of £27 per minute even though banks have put in place counter measures to stop this happening by randomly asking users for pins and also capping payments at £30 although there is still the incentive for thieves to steal them <a href="bibliography.html">(Hamilton, 2018)</a>. There is also a general fear in terms of how secure payments are over contactless payments but they are actually very secure and the transaction data is encrypted, contactless transaction also do not use the card number therefore adding another layer of security to using contactless as well as providing trust in the C2B relationship <a href="bibliography.html">(Humphries, 2016)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Ethical</h2>
                <p class="indent">Cryptocurrency is becoming more popular and alongside it comes some very serious ethical considerations. Cryptocurrencies like to pride themselves on the fact that they are very traceable when it comes to using their currency for example bitcoin state that on their website <q>Bitcoin is often perceived as an anonymous payment network. But in reality, Bitcoin is probably the most transparent payment network in the world</q> <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy" target="_blank">(Blockchain Wallet Users,ND)</a>. However there are guides online to help people make their bitcoins untraceable and through a method called bitcoin mixing users bitcoins can detach their identity from their coins but still be able to use them <a href="bibliography.html">(Khatwani, 2018)</a>. It is this anonymity which makes some ethical issues arise, through the anonymity users have been able to use the currency on the Dark Web to purchase things without governments or banks seeing. Bitcoin is the currency of the online underworld with reportedly 47% of transactions being related in someway to purchases on the Dark Web. Dark net markets have chosen to use these cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and therefore bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have essentially become a platform for users to obtain illegal things such as drugs, weapons and illegal services like defrauded credit cards provided on these dark net markets <a href="bibliography.html">(Deep Web, 2017)</a>. Bitcoin wallets are still being created at an upwards trend <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/my-wallet-n-users" target="_blank">(Blockchain Wallet Users,ND)</a> and alongside it is also an ever increasing use of these dark net markets which has had global effect and policing has not been prepared for such a thing <a href="bibliography.html">(Lusher, 2016)</a>.  The anonymity also leads to other major ethical concerns such as being able to fund terrorism, money laundering, and tax evasion. Prevention of crime is very difficult as well and most of the time the law can only be involved til after crimes have been committed <a href="bibliography.html">(Lucey, 2016)</a>. Another ethical concern of cryptocurrency is that it has lead to a new type of virus, cryptocurrency is mined by computers and so hackers have come up with viruses that have been able to hijack victims CPUs and allocate it power to mining cryptocurrency which is then sent to the hacker wallets and slowing the victim's computer. Over 500 million PCs being unaware that their computers are being throttled by this virus it is becoming an ever increasing issue <a href="bibliography.html">(Cuthbertson, 2017)</a>.</p>
                <p>A positive ethical consideration of the use of cryptocurrencies is that they can be perceived as beneficial to some countries. Countries such as Greece, India and Venezuela have been economically destroyed by big bank monopolies and corruption within their governments leaving their national currency in the decline, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin can help them to remove power and wealth from the state or banks who have affected them. Finance companies and governments must act a lot fairer as bitcoin offers low international costs compared to banks and also the currency cannot be affected by the government through inflation therefore protecting users money and providing a more economically sound situation for those users <a href="bibliography.html">(Gavriel, 2017)</a>.</p>
